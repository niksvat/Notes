 --------------------------Spring transactions-------------------
 

- Transactional in hibernate (very imp) [ @RetentionPolicy,  ]
- Propagation (https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-transaction-propagation)

	Transaction propogation only applies when we are calling another class instance method. If same instance
	method is called, then due to Spring AOP proxy, it won't be able to surround that particular method so its not
	really considered as separate method call from transaction perspective (Even if transaction annotation is there)

- Readonly, rollbackFor, norollbackFor
  If present in try catch block, and rollbackFor is used then transaction will not roll back, cause it is catched inside the funciton hence, function doesn't know that if raised.

=========================================
JAVA JVM
=========================================

- source code => byte code => compile to native computer code (codecache)
- jvm options to see which are being comiplied to native computer code
- it take time for compiler to optimize which code is re-used hence compiled to native lanugage
- C1, C2, C3, C4 compilers (4 is last level -> native compile)
- using jvm flag upate codecache size
- 32, 64 bit jvm
- client, server type of compilation
- "client" start quickly if no long or double is used
- for web server or any other use "server" compilation

- Stack, Heap, metaspace memory in java (before 7 it was perf)
- stack for primitive types and references
- heap for objects
  - we can increase initial and max heap size using jvm flags
- metaspace for static


- string pool:
  - automatic assigned reference variables to same string object, can't do for calculated strings
  - use intern() to put string in stringpool so it can be refernced again but also mind extra method call
  - it lives in heap
  - string stored like in hashmap and we can cahnges heapsiezz (initial, max, buckets etc) to optimize


- GC
  - java runs it automatically
  - we cau advise jvm to run garbage collection using system.gc() but we shouldn't do it
  - finalise method is deprecated and shouldn't be use
  - java optimisations: when gc runs it can see memory is not being used and can give it back to OS.
	- but if you set inittial to x, it won't allow going the heap size < x so thats one way


- heap
  - soft leak: there are object remain un referenced and gc havne't run (which are garbage)
  - use j(visual)vm to monitor heap size.
  - heatdump: enable jvm flag to print heap dump report in case of ooo
  - use tool from eclipse to analyse heap dump
