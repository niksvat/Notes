Types of DB:
===============
1. sql
2. nosql
	 - key value based (dynamo db)
     - document based (mongo db)	
	 - graph based (neo4j)
	 - wide columnar storage (time series like influxdb)
	 - column oriented db  (column stores)
	 
	 
	* Key Value Based: 
		= Table
		    = {
				key1: "", 
				key2: ""
			  }
	
	* Document Based:
		= Database
			= Collection1
			= Collection2 
				= Document1
					= Key "_id"
					= {
					     "firstName": "abs",
						 "lastName" : "cde"
					  },
					  {
					     "firstName": "x3s",
						 "lastName" : "csdde",
						 "Address" : " H NO 22"
					  }
				= Document2
	 
	 * Graph based (Neo4j)
		- each node has some property 
		- each node has list of neighbours
		
	 * Wide columnar based db: (timeseries or cassandra)
		- Data is stored in terms of columns (2d key value pair). 
		  means it can be accessed from row or column
		
		cassandra:
			= keyspace (db)
				= table
					= column (carmake, car_id, emp_id, etc..)

		timeseries: 
			= each row can represent data in particular hour (or time unit)
			
	 * Column oriented DB:
		- (diff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-column_store )
		- each column are stored separately in disk
